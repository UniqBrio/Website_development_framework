# THEME SYSTEM — polarity, paired tokens, and theme-aware contrast proof
<!-- website_workflow/theme_system.md — added 2026-08-24 via framework_update.md.
     ESCALATED, not patched. This failure class appeared twice:
     (1) 2026-08-24 UniqBotz run, finding M-01 "The framework assumes a DARK
         theme, and says so in rules, not just examples" — root-caused, a
         5-point master edit set proposed, never applied.
     (2) the owner's request for a runtime light/dark toggle.
     M-01's fix (a {THEME_POLARITY} variable, one polarity per site) would
     have been insufficient: {BG_0} still held ONE hex, so a site running
     BOTH themes remained inexpressible. framework_update.md step 6 requires
     redoing root cause rather than re-patching, so this file replaces the
     single-valued colour model outright. -->

## ROOT CAUSE THIS FILE CLOSES
The colour tokens were single-valued AND dark was written as a rule, not a
default: design_library.md said "constraints that ALWAYS apply: dark theme",
reference_site_analysis.md fit-checked every pattern against "dark theme",
and {ACCENT_2_TEXT} was defined as "legal as text ON DARK" — a dark-theme
rule wearing a contrast rule's clothes. M-01 proved the rule genuinely
inverts: purple #6708C0 measures 8.85:1 on white (legal) while orange
#DE7D14 measures 2.98:1 (illegal) — the exact opposite of the dark guidance.
A rule that names a colour instead of a measurement is not a contrast rule.

## {THEME_MODE} — the switch that governs everything below
Set in site_profile.md. One of:
- **SINGLE-DARK** — DEFAULT for a new site. One dark palette. No toggle.
  Everything in this file except §PAIRED TOKENS applies trivially (one
  column filled).
- **SINGLE-LIGHT** — one light palette. No toggle.
- **DUAL** — light AND dark ship, with a runtime toggle. OPT-IN, because a
  toggle is real recurring cost: every token doubles, every asset needs a
  theme-safe treatment, and the evidence gate doubles. Choose it because
  the audience needs it, not because it looks modern. Score it like any
  other option (decision_matrix.md) rather than assuming it.
A site is SINGLE-DARK unless the owner says otherwise.

## PAIRED TOKENS (site_profile.md carries both columns when {THEME_MODE}=DUAL)
Every colour token is a PAIR. In SINGLE modes, fill one column and write
"n/a" in the other — never leave it blank, so a later switch to DUAL shows
exactly what is missing.

| Token | Role | Inverts? |
|---|---|---|
| {BG_0} | page background | yes |
| {BG_1} | card / raised surface | yes |
| {FG_0} | primary text | yes |
| {FG_1} | secondary / muted text | yes |
| {BORDER} | dividers, input outlines | yes |
| {ACCENT_1} | primary action fill | often the SAME hex both themes |
| {ACCENT_1_ON} | text/icon placed ON an {ACCENT_1} fill | yes |
| {ACCENT_2} | secondary accent | often same hex |
| {ACCENT_2_TEXT} | measured text-safe variant of {ACCENT_2} | yes |
| {FOCUS_RING} | focus indicator | yes |
| {SHADOW} | elevation | **inverts in KIND, not just value** |

Two traps this table exists to catch:
- **{ACCENT_1_ON}** — nothing previously forced anyone to measure the label
  sitting ON the primary button. That is how a 2.98:1 white-on-orange CTA
  reached an approved plan (UniqBotz M-02). The most important text on the
  page had no token.
- **{SHADOW}** — a black drop shadow tuned for a light theme is invisible on
  dark. Dark themes signal elevation with a lighter surface or a subtle
  glow, not a darker shadow. Copying the light value across is a silent
  loss of all depth cues.

## CONTRAST IS COMPUTED, NOT PHOTOGRAPHED
The gate's PRIMARY evidence is an assertion over the token matrix, not a
screenshot. Screenshots spot-check; the computation proves.
1. Enumerate every (foreground token × surface token) pair that actually
   occurs in the UI — {FG_0}/{FG_1}/{ACCENT_2_TEXT} on {BG_0}/{BG_1};
   {ACCENT_1_ON} on {ACCENT_1}; {BORDER} and {FOCUS_RING} against both
   surfaces.
2. Compute the WCAG ratio for each, in EVERY active theme:
   relative luminance L per channel c in {R,G,B}: c_srgb = c/255;
   c_lin = c_srgb/12.92 if c_srgb <= 0.03928 else ((c_srgb+0.055)/1.055)^2.4;
   L = 0.2126*R_lin + 0.7152*G_lin + 0.0722*B_lin;
   ratio = (L_lighter + 0.05) / (L_darker + 0.05).
3. Thresholds: **4.5:1** body text · **3:1** large text (>=24px, or >=18.66px
   bold) · **3:1** UI component boundaries and focus indicators (WCAG 1.4.11).
4. Output a table: pair · theme · measured ratio · PASS/FAIL. Any FAIL blocks
   the gate. A ratio is a number — never round one up to make it pass, and
   never substitute "looks fine".
5. TOKEN PARITY (DUAL only): every token defined in one theme MUST have its
   counterpart. A missing pair is an automatic FAIL — this single check
   catches the most common theming bug, a colour added for one theme only.

## WHAT DOES NOT AUTO-UPDATE ON TOGGLE (the real failure list)
A CSS-variable swap updates less than people assume. Each item below has to
be handled deliberately, and each is a known invisible-text source:
- **Charts** — most libraries read colours ONCE at init and ignore later
  CSS-variable changes; the chart keeps light-theme axis/label colours on a
  dark page. Re-initialise or re-theme on toggle. (Also see
  resource_registry.md R-05: a marketing site often needs no chart library.)
- **Canvas / WebGL** — same problem; nothing is CSS-driven.
- **SVG with hardcoded `fill`/`stroke`** — use `currentColor` or per-theme
  variables. An inline logo with `fill="#111"` disappears on dark.
- **Images with a baked background** — need a transparent-background version,
  a per-theme variant, or a container that never inverts. Route through
  web-illustration-asset-production-pipeline, which already owns theme
  variants.
- **`<meta name="theme-color">`** — browser chrome stays the old colour.
- **Scrollbars** — set `color-scheme` so native scrollbars/controls follow.
- **Native form controls** — `accent-color`, and date/select popups.
- **Focus rings** — a ring tuned to one surface can vanish on the other; it
  is a 3:1 requirement, not decoration.
- **Shadows** — see the token table; they invert in kind.
- **Third-party embeds** (maps, video, widgets) — often cannot be themed;
  give them a neutral frame rather than pretending they switch.
- **`prefers-color-scheme` media-query assets** — an asset chosen by media
  query ignores an explicit user toggle that disagrees with the OS.

## SWITCHING IMPLEMENTATION (DUAL only)
- **No flash of the wrong theme.** With SSR (this framework's default stack
  is Next.js App Router), the server cannot know the client's stored choice.
  Resolve the theme before first paint via a blocking inline script that
  sets the theme attribute on the root element — hydrating afterwards
  produces a visible flash and, in React, a hydration mismatch.
- **Initial default** = `prefers-color-scheme`, then an explicit user choice
  overrides and PERSISTS across navigation and reload.
- **The toggle is a control**, so it obeys the same rules as any other:
  >=44px tap target, keyboard reachable, focus visible, an accessible name
  that states what it does, and `aria-pressed`/equivalent state.
- **The transition itself** is motion: animation_library.md's rules apply,
  including `prefers-reduced-motion` (switch instantly rather than
  cross-fading) and mid-transition contrast under Q-STATE-CONTRAST.

## VALIDATION MATRIX — sampling rule (prevents combinatorial theatre)
Naively, 6 profiles x 2 themes x 7 states = 84 captures per component. That
rule would be ignored within a week, so it is not the rule. Instead:
1. **Computed contrast table** — ALL pairs, ALL active themes. Exhaustive
   and cheap. This is the proof.
2. **Token parity assertion** — DUAL only. Cheap.
3. **At-rest screenshots** — full TIER 1 profile sweep (responsive_matrix.md)
   PER THEME. 6 for SINGLE, 12 for DUAL.
4. **State sweep** — default/hover/focus/active/disabled per theme, at the
   320 profile ONLY (breaks concentrate at the narrowest width), for each
   new/changed interactive component.
5. **Transition capture** — one mid-transition frame per direction (2), DUAL
   only.
6. **Any component whose colours differ between themes** gets its own
   at-rest capture in both, regardless of the above.
Anything not covered above is spot-checked, and the verdict says so.

## HANDOFF
- Tokens and {THEME_MODE} live in site_profile.md.
- Contrast/parity results and screenshots land in the Phase 5 evidence
  folder and are linked from the GATE 5 verdict (qa_evidence_gate.md).
- Q-STATE-CONTRAST (interrogation_checklist.md) treats theme as an AXIS:
  the matrix is states x themes, not states within one theme.
